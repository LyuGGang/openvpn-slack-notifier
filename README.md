OpenVPN-Slack-Notifier
=======

This codes help to notify new connection of clients from [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) to [Slack](https://slack.com) using post-auth and incoming-webhook. 
Since [server-side scripting with `client-connect` option deprecated](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/explanation-of-client-side-scripting-with-simple-examples/) on OpenVPN, we should use [post-auth](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/post-auth-programming-notes-and-examples/) feature instead. This codes referenced [this sample code](http://swupdate.openvpn.net/scripts/post_auth_mac_address_checking.py).
